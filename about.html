            get serious and start to study it, as it is never too late! took me long than expected decided to go ahead because I was scared and I believed that I would never being able 
            to achieve it, but guess what! Consistency and hard work pays off. Both as a person and 
            professional I love having challenges and goals to achieve, which is also perfectly reflected in the sport I practice, armwrestling and also I enjoy dancing.
